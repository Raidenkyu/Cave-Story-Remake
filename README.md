# Cave_Story_Remake
A remake of the famous indie game Cave story made in Visual Studio, with C++ and with SDL lib

At the actual state, the game only has a character that moves with input from the keyboard. It's possible that I won't complete the project, because the major goals, which are learning how to make multimedia programs,were already accomlplished.
