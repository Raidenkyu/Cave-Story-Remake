# Cave Story Remake
A remake of the famous indie game Cave story made in Visual Studio, with C++ and with SDL lib

At the actual state, the game only has a character that moves with input from the keyboard. It's possible that I won't complete the project, because the major goals, which are learning how to make multimedia programs,were already accomlplished.


## Setup the project

- First, be sure you have SDL2 and SDL2_image libraries installed in your machine.
- Then clone the Project
- After that, run `bin/setup` in the root of the folder

## Build the project

- Just run `bin/build`

## Run the project

- Just run `bin/run` (if there's any change in the sources, this will build before run)
